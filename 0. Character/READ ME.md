# <center> D&D 5e Character Vault </center>
*v0.1*

## Inspiration
- Nicole van der Hoeven's blog post: [How I use obsidian for D&D - Player Edition](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210809-dnd-obsidian-player/)
- The template pack provided by sklore! Thank you!
- The OGL SRD for 5th edition compiled by [OldManUmby](https://ogl-srd5.com/)


## How to use
The character vault is meant to be dropped into a fresh vault so the player can get to playing as quickly as possible. While the character sheet was specifically designed for dungeons and dragons 5th edition. The rest of the file structure can be used for most any other system.

###  0. Character Folder
The 0. Character Folder contains the core notes of the vault and is meant to be used with a multi-panel operation, making heavy use of collapsing headers to save space and speed up information location. 

The [[Character Sheet]] is the central note and has links to all the other character notes. Ideally all other notes should connect from these six notes. 

[[Backstory]] is the note intended so the player can input the information export it and be able to send it to their GM.

[[Class Abilities]] is strait forward, if you're inclined you can input your class abilities for ease of reference either completely in note or  linked to a specific note.

For the more active parts of the game [[Combat]] is the go to. Here you'll find your AC, Health, and similar information.

For keeping track of everything in your back pack and more see the [[Inventory]]  note.

Finally the [[Magic]] note helps keep tabs on spell slots, and contains a 'spell book' where you can link spells either to notes or to D&D beyond if you want.

I have also included the 5th edition SRD to help jump start the vault.

### Folders 1 Through 3
These folders are where a bulk of the notes should end up living. Ideally either linking back to a session note or one of the character notes.

### The Utility Folder
Here we have folders for both frequently used markdown code notes and templates.
