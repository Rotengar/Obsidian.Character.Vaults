# Obsidian.Character.Vaults
_A collection of premade TTRPG themed vaults for players and GMs._

These vaults are designed to be 'drop in' and go as is, or users can edit them to their hearts content.

## How to use
0. If you haven't already downloaded and installed [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) now would be a good time.
1. Download the vault for the game you're playing, it's important as each vault will have notes specific to that game's system.
2. Create an empty vault
3. Settings > Community Plugins > Toggle 'Safe mode' off, close settings.
4. Uncompress the .zip file downloaded from here dropping the contents directly into the root folder of the vault, the notes will load.
5. Verify that the community plugins are active.
6. Have fun!
